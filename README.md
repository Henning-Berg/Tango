# Tango
This repository describes Tango², version 2.2, software for Computer-Human Improvisation. Tango² listens to an improvising musician, analyses what it hears and plays musical responses which relate directly to the musical input.
If the improviser in turn reacts to these answers, a musical loop between the human and the machine can emerge. The way input and reaction correlate and the predictability of Tango’s responses can be defined by the user via a setup of improvising environments, called Rooms.
